<p align="center">A Minecraft session token strealer written in Python 3.</p>

**What can I use these tokens for?** You can use these tokens to hijack accounts (gain access to them without their password) temporarily, as if they restart their game, their session token will get changed. 

# Features
 - No local caching
 - Transferring via Discord webhook
 - \[**todo**\] No external Python modules needed

<br>

# How to use
 1. Create a webhook on your Discord server. I recommend creating a new server.
 2. Change the 'WEBHOOK_URL' variable value to your Discord webhook URL in [token-stealer.py](token-stealer.py)
 3. *(obfuscate the code or install it as a backdoor in an other script.)*
 4. Send the script to your victim and make them run it.

<br>

# Requirements on Victim's Machine
- Python 3.x
- 'discord_webhook' PIP module, installed via `python -m pip install discord_webhook`.
